This is a half-bidge SiC module.
Since only bonding wires are used for power loop connections, this is a wire-bonded module.
Since single device layer is used, it is a 2D module.
Single-sided cooling
Kelvin source connection is not available.
There is no gate loop here. Gate signals are shifted to another PCB board.
