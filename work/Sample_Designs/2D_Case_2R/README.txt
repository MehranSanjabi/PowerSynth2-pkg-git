This is a half-bridge SiC module.
Since only bonding wires are used for both gate and power loop connections, this is a wire-bonded module.
Since single device layer is used, it is a 2D module.
Single-sided cooling
Kelvin source connection is not available.
To turn-off the reliability constraint application, please make sure in the macro script, 'Reliability-awareness' is set to 0.
