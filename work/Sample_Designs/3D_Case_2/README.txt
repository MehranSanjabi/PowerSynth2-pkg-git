This is a half-bridge SiC module.
Since both wire bonding and metallic post-type connections are used, this is a hybrid architecture.
Since multiple device layers are stacked vertically, it is a 3D module.
It has a through ceramic via connected DBC and two other DBCs for double-sided cooling.
Kelvin source connection is present.
This case is used in ECCE 2020:
