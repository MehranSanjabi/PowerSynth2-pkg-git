This is a half-bridge SiC module.
Since only metallic post-type connections are used, this is a wire-bondless architecture.
Since multiple device layers are stacked vertically, it is a 3D module.
There is a through cermaic via DBC and two other DBCs are stacked for double-sided cooling.
Kelvin source connection is not available.
